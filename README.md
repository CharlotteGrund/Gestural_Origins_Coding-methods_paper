# Gestural_Origins_Coding-methods_paper

This repository contains the ESM material of the paper "GesturalOrigins: An ELAN Framework for Establishing Systematic Gesture Data Across Ape Species" as well as the code and the data for the worked examples. The datasets contain the already calculated response latencies and gesture durations that are relevant for the paper. For the coded raw data as well as any updates in the protocol/definition sheets please contact us on https://github.com/Wild-Minds/GesturalOrigins.
