# Gestural_Origins_Coding-methods_paper

This repository contains the electronic supplementary material (ESM) of the paper "GesturalOrigins: A bottom-up framework for establishing systematic gesture data across ape species" as well as the code and the data for the worked examples. The datasets contain the already calculated response latencies and gesture durations that are relevant for the paper. For the coded raw data and updates on the protocol and its definition sheets please check here: https://github.com/Wild-Minds/GesturalOrigins. The video tutorial on how to use the coding template is available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoShxy1vYe4&list=PLAidTwBvwFPkRdZ2OMVntnfmfOgozomr6&index=43. Check Alex Mielke's GitHub (https://github.com/AlexMielke1988) for clustering analysis packages using data coded with the Gestural Origins scheme (and for questions on the export function extract_Elan.R)
